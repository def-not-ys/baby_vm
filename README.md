# baby_vm
baby_vm is a virtual machine (VM) that implements [ons-instruction set computer (OISC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer).

## General information
Inspired by [this tutorial](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/) for writing your own vm, I got the idea of writing a simple baby vm that only runs one instruction and see how far I can get.

The one instruction that runs on `baby_vm` is `SUBLEQ`
```
    Instruction subleq a, b, c
        Mem[b] = Mem[b] - Mem[a]
        if (Mem[b] â‰¤ 0)
            goto c
```

A simple ISA around `SUBLEQ` was also deigned for `baby_vm` to interpret the assmebly files.

`baby_vm` has its own memory and hardware models.

All design deatils are documented in `/doc/DOCUMENTATION.md`.

This project is for fun and educational purpose, not meant to be useful. :)

## How to run

By the time this is publish, I should have dockerize `baby_vm`. So the following steps should get `baby_vm` up and running:

1) make sure `docker` is installed.
* `docker --version` will show if docker is installed.

2) from the project directory, build docker
* `cd baby_vm/`
* `docker build`

3) run docker
* `docker run`

4) `baby_vm` will propmt you to enter the assmebly files that you want to run, there are some example files supplied in `baby_vm/examples/`, enter the file name with path relative to the project directory. for example:
* `examples/test.txt`
* if you want to run your own assembly file (please refer to `doc/DOCUMENTATION.md` for ISA), make sure enter the file name **with the path relative to the project directory**.

5) watch `baby_vm` run :)
